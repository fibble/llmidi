> AI-powered MIDI composition through natural language conversations

⚠️ **WORK IN PROGRESS** - This is an early-stage project and highly experimental! ⚠️

**llmidi** is a planned open-source Electron application that will transform musical ideas into MIDI sequences using conversational AI. The vision: describe what you want to hear in plain English, and watch as AI generates the perfect musical parts for your compositions.

## 🚧 Current Status

This project is in **very early development**. Currently exploring concepts and gathering community input. Most features described below are planned functionality, not yet implemented.

**What exists now:**
- Project structure and planning
- Technology research and architecture decisions
- Community building and requirements gathering

**Coming next:**
- Basic Electron app setup
- OpenRouter API integration
- First MIDI generation prototype

## 🎯 Vision & Planned Features

### 🎵 Natural Language Music Generation *(Planned)*
- **Conversational Interface**: Describe musical ideas in plain English ("create a funky bassline", "add a jazzy piano melody")
- **Iterative Refinement**: Build and refine musical parts through natural conversation ("make it more syncopated", "add some slides")
- **Genre-Aware**: AI understands musical styles, moods, and terminology

### 🎹 Multi-Track Composition *(Planned)*
- **Independent Tracks**: Generate bass, melody, chords, drums, and custom instrument parts
- **Per-Track Context**: Each track maintains its own conversation history for focused development
- **Inter-Track Awareness**: Generate parts that complement existing tracks ("create a melody that works with this bassline")

### 👁️ Visual MIDI Display *(Planned)*
- **Piano Roll Views**: Clear visual representation of generated MIDI notes for each track
- **Real-Time Playback**: Visual playhead shows current playback position
- **Multi-Track Overview**: See all generated parts simultaneously with individual track controls

### 🔊 Flexible Audio Preview *(Planned)*
- **Built-In Instruments**: Quick auditioning with piano, electric piano, strings, bass, and percussion
- **Professional Integration**: Route tracks to your DAW via virtual MIDI ports for high-quality VST playback
- **Solo/Mute Controls**: Compare and arrange parts with standard mixer-style controls

### 🎛️ Professional DAW Integration *(Planned)*
- **Virtual MIDI Routing**: Each track appears as a separate MIDI device in your DAW
- **Live Recording**: Generate and record MIDI directly into DAW tracks during sessions
- **Standard Workflow**: Works with any DAW that supports MIDI input (Ableton, Logic, Pro Tools, FL Studio, etc.)

### 📁 Export & Sharing *(Planned)*
- **MIDI Export**: Save individual tracks as standard MIDI files
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Open Source**: Fully transparent and community-driven development

## 🚀 Getting Started (When Ready)

*This section will be updated as development progresses*

1. **Download** releases will be available for Windows, macOS, and Linux
2. **Set up** OpenRouter API key for AI music generation  
3. **Generate** musical ideas through natural language
4. **Export** or route to your DAW for production

## 🎯 Planned Use Cases

### Rapid Ideation
- Break through writer's block with AI-generated musical sketches
- Explore new genres and musical styles
- Generate backing tracks for improvisation practice

### Professional Workflow Enhancement
- Create foundation tracks for further development in your DAW
- Generate reference parts for band arrangements
- Quickly prototype musical ideas before full production

### Learning & Experimentation
- Study AI-generated musical patterns and structures
- Experiment with unfamiliar musical styles
- Learn through iterative conversation with AI

## 🛠️ Planned Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Electron with React
- **AI Integration**: OpenRouter API for LLM access
- **MIDI Processing**: Node.js MIDI libraries
- **Audio Engine**: Tone.js for built-in instrument playback
- **Visualization**: Custom piano roll components
